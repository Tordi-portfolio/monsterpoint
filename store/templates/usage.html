        <h1>MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxy methamphetamine) - A Comprehensive Medical Overview</h1>
    </nav>
    <nav>
        <h3> Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            MDMA (3-4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is a synthetic, psychoactive drug with a chemical structure similar to the stimulant methamphetamine and the hallucinogen mescaline. It commonly referred to as Ecstasy or Molly by users. <br>
            MDMA is an illegal drug that acts as both a stimulant and psychedelic, producing an energizing effect, as well as distortions in time and perception and enhanced enjoyment from tactile experiences. MDMA is a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which means that the DEA has determined that it has no medical benefit and a high potential for abuse. <br>
            MDMA was first synthesized by a German company in 1912, possibly to be used as an appetite suppressant. It has been available as a street drug since the 1980s, and use escalated in the 1990s among college students and young adults. Then, it was most often distributed at late-night parties called "raves", nightclubs, and rock concerts. <br>
            As the rave and club scene expanded to metropolitan and suburban areas across the country, MDMA use and distribution increased as well. MDMA is frequently used in combination with other drugs. Today, the drug is still used by a broader group of people who more commonly call it Ecstasy or Molly.
        </p>
        <h3>How To Take</h3>
        <p>
            MDMA stimulates the release of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, from brain neurons producing a high that lasts from 3 to 6 hours, but the length of a high is variable based on the user. The drug's rewarding effects vary with the individual taking it, the dose taken, purity of the MDMA, and the environment in which it is taken. <br>
            MDMA can produce stimulant effects such as an enhanced sense of pleasure and self-confidence and increased energy. Its psychedelic effects include feelings of peacefulness, acceptance, and empathy.
        </p>
        <h3>How does MDMA affect the brain?</h3>
        <p>
            MDMA exerts its primary effects in the brain on neurons that use the chemicals serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine to communicate with other neurons. <br>
            Serotonin is most likely responsible for the feelings of empathy, elevated mood, and emotional closeness experienced with this drug. Overall, these neurotransmitter systems play an important role in regulating:

        <h3>What Is Methamphetamine</h3>
        <p>
            Methamphetamine is a synthetic drug known for psychoactive effects. It is classified as a central nervous system stimulant and comes in a variety of forms such as powder, tablets, crystals and rock-like chunks. Depending on its form, methamphetamine can be snorted, injected, ingested or smoked. <br>
            Methamphetamine produces a euphoric high and can be used to increase alertness, energy and self-confidence. It also produces harmful physiological and psychological effects including headache, elevated heart rate and body temperature, hallucinations and delusions. Regular use is associated with an increased risk of addiction, psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment such as memory loss. <br>
            Methamphetamine is often produced illegally in laboratories using inexpensive chemicals found in medications, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. Illegal production can be dangerous due to the toxicity of other chemicals used and the high risk of explosions.

        <h3>How to Reduce Harm reduction</h3>
        <p>
            All drugs carry risks of harm.
            If you use crystal meth, here’s some suggestions for reducing the risk. This is a guide only.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span></span></li>
            <li><span>Start with a low dose - </span>then wait an hour before having more.</li>
            <li><span>Choose a safer method of use - </span>try smoking or snorting meth instead of injecting. Boil your smoking device in water to keep it clean.</li>
            <li><span>Avoid sharing needles and equipment - </span>to reduce the risk of transmitted viruses such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B and C. Clean syringes, safe disposal containers and sterile equipment are available at Needle and Syringe Programs (NSP) across Australia (Australia-wide NSP directory).</li>
            <li><span>Avoid mixing - </span>with alcohol and other drugs, it can increase your risk of overdose and other health issues. If you plan on mixing use our mixing calculator to find out which drugs are lower risk for mixing.</li>
            <li><span>Practice safe sex - </span>while you’re high. Use condoms and other safe sex equipment and lubricant, and have regular sexual health checks. Talk with your sexual partner about how much meth you’ll use and communicate your limits and what you plan to do.</li>
            <li><span>Use with people you know and trust - </span> to help you if something goes wrong.</li>
            <li><span>Take breaks, and plan time to sleep and rest.</span></li>
            <li><span>Drink water to prevent dehydration.</span></li>
            <li><span>Try to plan a healthy meal each day.</span></li>
            <li><span>Know how long it lasts - </span>so you know when it’s safe for you to drive or operate machinery. Check out our drug duration calculator for more info.</li>
            <li><span>Practice good dental hygiene - </span>regularly brush and floss your teeth, stay hydrated with water rather than sugary drinks, and visit the dentist regularly to help reduce the effects meth has on your teeth.</li>
            <li><span>Avoid frequent and regular use.</span></li>
